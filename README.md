# AviX-HTA-converter
A script to generate a HTA graph in LaTeX Tikiz from a AviX savefile

# Usage

if you are running linux run ./converter FILENAME.avx4 and the output should be in output.txt

if running Windows create a folder named tmp in the root directory
	Unzip the FILENAME.avx4 (it is a compressed folder) rename the output to "avix_out.xml"
	place the file in your tmp directory and run parser.py
 
Please Note, This script is not very robust and intended for a one time usage
